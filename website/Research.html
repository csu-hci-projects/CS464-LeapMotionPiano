                    <div>&nbsp</div>
					<p id="content">For this project, we conducted a small survey. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions, instead of allowing the participants to test the piano, we showed them a short video in place. The survey asks several demographic questions like age, gender, and field of study. It then asked if they played any instruments and got a feel for their musical background. It asks for things like what kind of instruments, the frequency they play, as well as others. Then, we asked participants to watch the video, which showcases an overview of the project, before completing the rest of the questions. After, there are a few additional questions regarding the virtual piano, like potential improvements and if a project like this would be helpful in the future.</p>

					<h3>Results:</h3>
                    <div>&nbsp</div>
                    <p id="content">We were able to get 19 responses to our survey, 5 of which were classmates. We had a wide range of participants, with ages ranging from 18 to 70. The gender ratio was about even and the majority of the participants were of a technical field. 11 people said they played an instrument, with 6 of the responses being piano. Of the 11 that played an instrument, the majority had taken music lessons. On a scale of 1 to 5, most of the participants said they rate the comparableness of the virtual piano and a real piano as a 3. There were a variety of responses to how we could improve the piano, including improving accuracy, adding differences in volume, and using a wider sensor to play more of the piano. Most people thought that with some improvements, this project could be a valuable tool in the future.</p>
