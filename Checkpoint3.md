# Prototype 1 for Checkpoint 3

For this checkpoint, we have taken a model built by a group from a previous semester and added to it. We have changed the layout of the project components, including the piano, leap motion, camera, and lighting. We then added a physics component that depresses the keys when played and plays an audio clip for each note. The Leap Motion portion has been very finicky, so a lot of time has been spent changing the setting in Unity to allow for a better user experience.

For Checkpoint 4 (the final submission, we hope to add a better physics component that will keep the keys depressed when the finger is pushing it. We will also add more octaves of notes.
